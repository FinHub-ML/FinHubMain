BYD Shares Face Earnings Test as China’s EV Price War Heats Up	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/byd-shares-face-earnings-test-002305199.html	"China’s biggest EV maker broke with its usual practice of not providing guidance ahead of its earnings report due later Monday. The stock’s volatility skew this month jumped to the highest since October 2022, indicating increased investor demand for downside protection. Slowing growth, a rush of new competitors and discounts initiated by Tesla Inc. last year have ramped up pressure in the Chinese EV market, the world’s largest. Investors will be scrutinizing BYD’s results comments for plans for further aggressive steps after a move to cut prices on mass-market models ahead of peers this year scored success. BYD “has fired off the first shot, taking market share from internal combustion-engine cars,” said Daisy Li, fund manager at EFG Asset Helped by the price reductions, BYD sold about 300,000 vehicles in March, rebounding from a pronounced weakness seen in the prior month. That helped the stock, which is down less than 1% in Hong Kong this year, while a gauge of global EV makers has declined more than 15%. Management HK Ltd. “EV penetration is rising and sales are growing, but that’s coming with lower profits.”The resilience may leave the shares vulnerable to selling pressure if the results disappoint. BYD is expected to post sales growth of 10% for the seasonally slow first quarter, which would be its lowest in four years. Gross profit margin is estimated to decline to 19.6% compared with 21.2% in the fourth quarter. While the price cuts for cheaper models have likely hurt its profitability, BYD’s growth in higher-end models and overseas sales are among key points traders will be watching for potential positives. “We believe BYD’s strategy is to leverage domestic mass products to maintain production utilization and operating leverage, and balance profit margins with premium models and exports,” said Bing Yuan, a fund manager at Edmond de Rothschild Asset Management. BYD has been expanding its luxury lineup, including the Auto China show launch of the Denza Z9GT, a shooting-brake style design with a heavy emphasis on technology. In Februray, it rolled out its $200,000-plus Yangwang U9 supercar to rival offerings from Ferrari NV and Lamborghini. The company has a target of selling 500,000 vehicles outside China this year, and then doubling that in 2025. It also plans to build its first European car factory in Hungary. “Exports coming from a low base are expected to continue to show strong growth — this will remain a key supporting factor for BYD’s revenue growth and likely margin,” said Robert Mumford, a portfolio manager at GAM Hong Kong Ltd. “Outside the leaders, we have been fairly bearish on the sector given high levels of competition and pricing pressure.”"
"Asian Stocks Track US Peers Higher, Yen in Focus: Markets Wrap"	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/asian-markets-eye-positive-open-222109297.html	"Equities in Australia and South Korea rose at the open, while the Japanese stock market is shut for a holiday. US contracts nudged higher after the S&P 500 rose 1% on Friday. Yen traders remain alert to efforts to support the currency that’s at its weakest in more than three decades. Australian bond yields fell, following US Treasuries on Friday. Chinese shares will be closely watched after industrial companies’ profits slumped in March as exports flagged and deflationary pressures persisted. The weakness in the latest data “casts doubts on whether the economic recovery seen early this year can be sustained,” Commerzbank strategists including Charlie Lay wrote in a note to clients. “It is important now that the government will follow through with their fiscal stimulus plan outlined in the National People’s Congress annual meeting back in March.” Asian technology stocks may move in early trading after earnings from Microsoft Corp. and Google’s parent Alphabet Inc. last week sent a clear message that spending on artificial intelligence and cloud computing is paying off. The rally in tech shares has helped trim the drop in global stocks this month to 2.7%, the first monthly loss since October, amid concerns over lingering inflation pressures and conflict in the Middle East. While the correction could be over, “there is a significant risk that it’s just a bounce from oversold conditions,” said Shane Oliver, chief economist and head of investment strategy at AMP Ltd. Still, any further selloff is unlikely to be deep and stocks will see more gains “as disinflation resumes, central banks ultimately cut interest rates and recession is avoided or proves mild,” he wrote in a note to clients. Traders will also be focusing on the Fed’s policy meeting on Wednesday after the central bank’s preferred measure of inflation rose at a brisk pace in March, though roughly in line with estimates. With officials likely to hold rates steady at a more than two-decade high, much of the focus will be on any pivot in the tone of the post-meeting statement and Chair Jerome Powell’s press conference. “With all measures of US consumer prices showing a steep acceleration over the past three to four months, the FOMC is bound to row back hard from its earlier predictions of meaningful policy easing this year,” Societe Generale economists including Klaus Baader wrote in a note to clients. “That said, markets have already scaled back pricing of rate cuts drastically, so unless Chair Powell plays up the possibility of rate hikes, the market damage is likely to be modest.” A gauge of US Treasury returns has slumped 2.3% this month, set for the biggest monthly drop since February last year, as hawkish Fedspeak and strong economic data pushed back rate-cut bets. Swaps traders now see only one Fed reduction for all of 2024, well below the roughly six quarter-point cuts they expected at the start of 2024."
"The AI trade is back, as confidence in Big Tech surges"	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/the-ai-trade-is-back-as-confidence-in-big-tech-surges-160013297.html	"The AI craze has returned to Wall Street — and investors are buying back in. Standout quarterly results from Microsoft (MSFT) and Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) plus a well-received IPO debut for Rubrik (RBRK) have put the AI narrative back on track, sparking renewed confidence that big tech’s expensive bets on splashy tools is boosting growth. Alphabet shares soared to an all-time high on Friday, closing above a $2 trillion market cap for the first time. Microsoft shares ended up 1.8%, sporting a market a shade over $3 trillion. “The AI investment story is intact,” BMO Wealth Management U.S. chief investment officer Yung-Yu Ma told Yahoo Finance. Outperformance by Microsoft and Alphabet, along with Elon Musk's automaker turn AI play Tesla (TSLA), pushed the S&P 500 (^GSPC) and Nasdaq (^IXIC) to their best weekly performance this year. “They're delivering on earnings,” HSBC’s Nicole Inui told Yahoo Finance. “This is a secular growth story, and we think the sector continues to stay strong over the second half of the year.”Results from Microsoft and Google gave Wall Street an early glimpse at how AI will drive stocks for years to come. Microsoft said AI services accounted for 7 percentage points of the 31% revenue jump in its Azure cloud division. Meanwhile, increasing contributions from AI helped Google’s cloud revenue surge 28%, compared to a year ago. “The commentary from both Google and Microsoft tells us that there is real demand for AI,” RBC Capital Markets analyst Rishi Jaluria told Yahoo Finance. “It's not just hype, it's not just people talking about it. There's actual capital being put to work.” In a note to clients this week, Bank of America’s Michael Hartnett wrote that “narrow mega-cap growth leadership” will remain intact until threats of a recession materialize. And the AI opportunity goes far beyond Microsoft and Google — the two companies often viewed by Wall Street as leaders in the AI race. RBC Capital Markets internet analyst Brad Erickson told Yahoo Finance that Meta’s (META) selloff following earnings was an “overreaction,” and believes AI will be a “transformational driver"" for the company. “We’d be buying it,” Erickson said. The rally in several Mag 7 stocks arrives ahead of key results from Amazon (AMZN) and Apple (AAPL) this coming week — two earnings reports that will be another critical test for the AI tech trade amid sky-high valuations."
Tesla and Microsoft presented 2 distinct versions of AI. Investors liked both.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tesla-and-microsoft-presented-2-distinct-versions-of-ai-investors-liked-both-120001115.html	"Investors were treated to two different versions of artificial intelligence this week. And both sound pretty good. Microsoft (MSFT) announced a partnership with Coca-Cola (KO) in which the soft drink king would pay $1.1 billion to “jointly experiment” with Microsoft’s new Azure AI-based version of its cloud-based suite of productivity software. And when Microsoft’s quarterly results showed AI driving more and more of its cloud business growth and bullish guidance from an enthusiastic leadership team, the stock rose 2% Friday. Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) had a similar story, but with a stronger investor reaction — up 10% Friday — as investors reconsidered the company’s second-place position to Microsoft. Now, it seems YouTube, search, and cloud businesses are strapped in and ready for their AI-ification. On the other side of the table was Tesla’s (TSLA) earnings presentation. The company doubled down on its endgame of fully autonomous vehicles, a robotaxi fleet, licensing self-driving tech to other automakers — they’re in conversations, Elon Musk said — and the potential of harnessing the AI computing power of parked Teslas to create something akin to Amazon’s AWS, a bold but old idea that has been floating around since the 1980s. These are two very different visions of an AI future. “Productivity software” certainly doesn’t have the same ring as “robotaxi,” which is on the fun end of Peter Thiel’s “we wanted flying cars, instead we got 140 characters” spectrum we discussed two weeks ago. But as our Chart of the Week shows, investors liked both of them. And they should. Tesla’s surge was partially about rebutting some reasonable investor fears — cutting costs to tackle lagging demand and reaffirming that cheaper EVs are on the way. But the bigger story was the self-driving AI vision from the grand visionary. This is rare, and it’s why some people love Elon. For the most part, the path of AI first runs through the tedious corporate world of programmatic advertising and productivity tools, the core businesses of today’s big AI software/cloud players — Google, Microsoft, and Meta. On the other hand, Tesla’s splashy self-driving future of consumer cars and robotaxis is far more aligned with the “change the world” Big Tech expectation (aspiration, really) than the “better Office 365” reality we so often see. But these more mundane improvements are everything. It’s important to remember the lessons that any regional American city will teach you: Tons of America’s rich simply took the practical route, embracing the less glamorous business of fast-food franchising, agricultural processing, waste management, car dealerships, commercial properties, not to mention all the other B2B things you’d never think twice about. For every Zuckerberg, there are thousands of Buddy Garritys. Zuckerberg, however, may have taken the mundane too far Wednesday in Meta’s earnings call by, as our Hamza Shaban put it, making AI aspirations “seem small.” The company talked about “scaling business messaging,” “better ad insertion,” and selling AI computing power. And as we wrote in March, breaking productivity barriers is huge for the economy. But you still have to sell them. After all, they're still ""productivity gains,"" not flying cars."
Tesla CEO Elon Musk Makes China Visit For FSD After Nixing India Trip	https://finance.yahoo.com/m/20bbf93a-d9aa-3d83-88ee-8d6a70d56588/tesla-ceo-elon-musk-makes.html	"Tesla (TSLA) CEO Elon Musk made a surprise visit to China on Sunday, meeting with government officials in an apparent effort to introduce Full Self-Driving software in the country. The move comes a week after Musk abruptly postponed an India trip for high-level talks for an investment there.China Premier Li Qiang, in a meeting with Musk, said Tesla's growth in China is ""a successful example of Sino-U.S. economic and trade cooperation"", the Chinese state broadcaster reported Sunday. Tesla is aiming to win regulatory approval for FSD, which isn't capable of self driving, in key markets such as China. On Tesla's April 23 earnings call, Musk said the EV giant aims to release FSD ""as a supervised autonomy system in any market that — where we can get regulatory approval for that, which we think includes China."" A key issue is that Tesla wants to transfer FSD data from China to the U.S. However, Tesla has cleared Beijing's data security tests, the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers announced shortly after the Musk-Li meeting. China bars Tesla from certain government facilities over data privacy concerns. The U.S. and China are at odds over local data sent overseas. President Biden last week signed into law a mandate for social site TikTok to separate from China parent Bytedance or be shut down, in part over data sent to China. Musk reported will visit the Beijing Auto Show on Monday. Tesla, which has no new EVs to show off, is not taking part. But rivals are showing off a slew of new models, with driver-assistance software becoming increasingly common. Tesla's sales are struggling in the face of intense competition and aggressive pricing. Tesla itself announced new price cuts earlier this month. Passage To India Delayed On April 20, Musk abruptly cancelled a scheduled April 21-22 visit to New Delhi, citing ""very heavy Tesla obligations."" He had been set to meet with Prime Minister Narendra Modi and was expected to announce a big investment in India, including a Tesla factory. An India factory would let Tesla enter a huge potential market, bypassing heavy import duties. But a low-cost Tesla EV would be hugely important to tap India, which also has more-limited EV charging infrastructure. Tesla Stock Tesla stock surged 14.4% last week to 168.29, reversing higher from a 15-month low. The EV giant's Q1 EPS missed lowered expectations, but investors cheered Tesla's plans for ""affordable"" EVs while Elon Musk touted robotaxis and predicted higher deliveries in 2024. Shares fell 1.1% on Friday, once again hitting resistance around the 10-week moving average. Late Thursday, the National Highway Transportation Safety Administration said it was opening a new probe of Tesla self-driving systems amid concerns that a 2023 move to improve driver monitoring and attention was falling short. The NHTSA also appeared to implicitly pin part of the blame for Autopilot and FSD accidents on Tesla, not just the driver."
