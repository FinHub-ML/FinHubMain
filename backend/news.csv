"Economic Indicators and Their Impact on the Construction Industry","https://marketbusinessnews.com/?p=380909","Economic indicators play a crucial role in shaping the landscape of various industries, and the construction sector is no exception. These indicators provide critical data that help firms predict future market conditions, prepare for changes, and make informed decisions. For businesses involved in construction, understanding these metrics can mean the difference between thriving and merely surviving, especially in a volatile economic environment. The use of construction management software significantly enhances the ability of firms to adapt to economic shifts by providing tools that streamline operations and improve project outcomes.  Gross Domestic Product (GDP) is one of the primary indicators of economic health in a country. In the context of construction, an increase in GDP typically signals growth in construction demand due to higher consumer and business confidence which leads to more investment in infrastructure and buildings. Conversely, a decline in GDP can lead to a reduction in construction activities as businesses cut back on expenditure and new projects due to economic uncertainty.  Interest rates, set by the central bank, are a critical determinant of the construction industry's health. Lower interest rates make borrowing cheaper, encouraging individuals and businesses to take on new loans to fund construction projects. This increase in financing activity helps boost the construction sector. On the other hand, high interest rates might restrict borrowing and slow down the construction industry as financing new projects becomes more expensive.  The unemployment rate is a direct indicator of the economic environment and consumer spending confidence. High unemployment rates generally decrease disposable income and reduce demand for new residential and commercial properties, impacting the construction sector negatively. Lower unemployment rates suggest a healthier economy, which boosts construction business as more projects are likely to be initiated.  Construction spending measures the total dollar value of construction work done in the area. This indicator helps businesses gauge the market's vitality and anticipate future demand in various construction sub-sectors like residential, commercial, and industrial. Trends in construction spending can significantly affect related decisions in project management, budget allocations, and workforce planning.  Incorporating construction management software is increasingly becoming essential in navigating the complex landscape influenced by these economic indicators. This technology offers robust tools for project management, budget management, scheduling, compliance, and safety management, which are crucial for enhancing operational efficiencies and reducing costs amidst economic changes.  For instance, during periods of high interest rates, construction management software can help firms optimize their budgets and schedules to prevent overruns and delays. The software provides real-time data analytics, which allows managers to make quick adjustments based on immediate financial insights and market conditions.  Moreover, construction management software significantly enhances a firm's predictive capabilities. By analyzing data trends from various economic indicators, the software can forecast market conditions and help businesses prepare for the impact. This proactive approach in using predictive analytics can be the difference between capitalizing on opportunities and falling behind due to unexpected market shifts.  Effective communication and collaboration across various stakeholders are vital in construction. Management software facilitates seamless communication and documentation, ensuring that all parties are up-to-date with changes in economic conditions and their potential impacts on the project. This integration helps in avoiding miscommunications and delays, saving costs and time.  As economic indicators continue to influence the construction industry, the integration of advanced tools like construction management software becomes critical. These tools not only help in managing the immediate effects of economic changes but also in planning and forecasting future market conditions accurately. For construction companies, staying ahead of the curve means being responsive to economic indicators through enhanced capabilities provided by technology, ensuring resilience and competitiveness in a challenging market. As such, embracing these technological solutions is not just beneficial but necessary for the survival and growth of businesses in the construction sector."
"New Abacus poll shows B.C. Conservatives within six points of B.C. NDP","https://www.surreynowleader.com/news/new-abacus-poll-shows-bc-conservatives-within-six-points-of-bc-ndp-7358854","Poll predicts likely NDP majority government, but says it is becoming less certain  A new poll of committed voters sees the provincial Conservatives under John Rustad climbing to within six points of the B.C. NDP.  ""What looked like an easy (B.C.) NDP victory at the end of last year now looks more uncertain now,"" David Coletto, Abacus Data chief executive officer, said.  But if the poll shows a substantial shift in the intention of voters toward the provincial Conservatives, Coletto also sees the provincial New Democrats likely winning another majority.  The party, he added, remains in a ""strong position, despite widespread concern about the cost of living and the direction of the province.""  The poll released Tuesday (May 14) shows the B.C. NDP would receive 40 per cent of the decided vote, down four per cent from a poll conducted in November, while the provincial Conservatives would receive 34 per cent, up eight per cent. B.C. United under Leader Kevin Falcon would receive 13 per cent, down four per cent. The B.C. Greens would receive 10 per cent, up one per cent.  Eby remains by far the most popular provincial party leader with a net positive rating of 13 per cent, followed by B.C. Green Leader Sonia Furstenau (plus two per cent) and Rustad (minus three per cent). Falcon has a net approval rating of -15 per cent. Coletto added that Rustad is no more known than he was at the end of last year.  The B.C. NDP is ahead by six point in Metro Vancouver, by 15 points on Vancouver Island and statistically tied with the B.C. Conservatives in the Interior and North.  Coletto said the provincial Conservatives ""have likely benefited"" from both the popularity of the federal Conservatives and also B.C.'s difficult economic situation. According to the poll, 51 per cent of surveyed voters describe the provincial economy as poor or terrible with New Democratic supporters far more likely to feel positive about the economy than those supporting the provincial Conservatives. The poll also finds that almost half of surveyed voters -- 47 per cent -- want a change in government.  ""We are building a very strong grassroots movement across this province,"" Rustad said, when asked about the poll results. ""It's actually very encouraging to see the people that are coming and are joining what we are doing right across this province, whether it's down here in Victoria, whether it's up in the Northeast, whether it's in the Kootenays, whether it's the Okanagan, whether it's in Surrey.""  RELATED: Conservatives becoming perfect 'foil' for B.C. NDP election hopes: SFU prof  Rustad added that the poll reflects people wanting change after decades of government by both the B.C. Liberals -- now B.C. United -- and the B.C. NDP.  ""We want a government that is going to deliver for people and fight for the average-day person and that's what I'm hearing time and time again.""  Reporters attending an unrelated event by Premier David Eby Tuesday morning also heard Rustad's name multiple times as he frequently pivoted to criticize the provincial Conservatives on a range of issues.  ""I think it is important for me to make sure people understand the choice that is on the ballot between now and the election,"" he said, when asked about the poll. ""I have been clear from the beginning -- the (provincial) Conservatives are a real threat. They are going to cost British Columbians in very tangible ways: canceling schools projects, re-lighting the dumpster fire at ICBC, canceling ICBC rates, canceling rebates for B.C. Hydro and just last week, putting into question a woman's right to choose.""  With this last comment, Eby was referring to comments from B.C. Conservative House Leader Bruce Banman when he said during Question Period that motherhood begins at the ""moment of conception.""  Banman later told Postmedia that women have the right to choose what to do with their bodies after the B.C. NDP and the two other opposition parties seized on Banman's comments.  Rustad Tuesday (May 14) said his party has no intention to open the abortion debate.  ""The issue was resolved in 1988 (by the Supreme Court of Canada) and we have no intention to address this or try to raise this issue again,"" he said."

"Africa Energy Announces Corporate Update and First Quarter 2024 Results","https://news.cision.com/africa-energy/r/africa-energy-announces-corporate-update-and-first-quarter-2024-results,c3980001","VANCOUVER, BC, May 14, 2024 /CNW/ - Africa Energy Corp. (TSX Venture: AFE) (Nasdaq First North: AEC) (""Africa Energy"" or the ""Company""), an oil and gas exploration company, announces corporate update and financial and operating results for the three months ended March 31, 2024.  FINANCIAL AND OPERATIONAL UPDATE  The Company's financial results for the three months ended March 31, 2024, have been negatively impacted by a US$23.1 million non-cash loss on revaluation of our investment in Block 11B/12B, which was due to changes in base assumptions for discount rates applied in the discounted cash flow model for valuing our interest in Block 11B/12B.  On April 25, 2024, the National Council of Provinces approved the Upstream Petroleum Resources Development Bill (""UPRDB""), which will now be tabled for presidential assent. Once presidential assent of the UPRDB is obtained, the industry will have more certainty and clarity, which is expected to drive investment in South Africa.  As part of South Africa's commitment to the Paris Climate Agreement, it must diversify energy mix, reducing its reliance on ageing coal fired power plants. In an effort to fulfill this commitment, the Department of Mineral Resources and Energy announced the draft Gas Master Plan (""GMP"") in April 2024 and the Integrated Resource Plan 2023 (""IRP 2023"") in January 2024, both designed to balance demand and supply of energy, including the use of natural gas, until 2050 as the country transitions its energy mix accordingly and provides the country with reliable base load generation capacity while ensuring compliance with emission reduction plans. IRP 2023 is a two phased approach to dealing with the electricity crisis, with phase one focusing on power system requirements up to 2030 and phase two focusing on long-term energy mix pathways to guide long-term policy choices. Phase two of IRP 2023 identifies the need to roll out dispatchable power including gas to provide security of power supply to South Africa and references more than 7 gigawatts of new gas-to-power requirements. The Company believes the program for phase two with associated transmission network upgrades needs to begin earlier if energy supply security is the objective of the IRP 2023.  The use of indigenous gas, potentially including the discovered resources from Block 11B/12B as identified in IRP 2023 and the draft GMP, will be part of the solution to South Africa's energy crisis and will have positive implications for the South African economy. In addition, the government of South Africa has committed to the unbundling of the government-owned electricity supplier into separate entities; Transmission, Generation and Distribution, creating an entity focused on expansion of the electricity grid, which is critical to allow future tie‐in of potential gas‐to-power projects.  OUTLOOK  The Block 11B/12B joint venture has applied for the Production Right and is contemplating an early production system (""EPS"") for a phased development of the Paddavissie Fairway. The EPS would provide first gas and condensate production from the Luiperd discovery and would accelerate the Block 11B/12B development timeline by utilizing nearby infrastructure on the adjacent block in order to supply natural gas to customers in Mossel Bay for the conversion of natural gas to power and/or liquid petroleum products. The EPS would significantly decrease the capital expenditures required to reach first production on Block 11B/12B. The Company expects that a full development of the Paddavissie Fairway would follow the EPS as the gas market expands in South Africa. We are encouraged by the 2D and 3D seismic data that has identified additional prospectivity in the Paddavissie Fairway and to the east, confirming the large exploration upside remaining across the block.  HIGHLIGHTS  FINANCIAL INFORMATION  (Unaudited; thousands of US dollars, except per share amounts)  The financial information in this table was selected from the Company's unaudited condensed interim consolidated financial statements for the three months ended March 31, 2024 (the ""Financial Statements""), which are available on SEDAR at www.sedar.com and the Company's website at www.africaenergycorp.com.  EARNINGS TREND AND FINANCIAL POSITION  (Unaudited; US dollars)  The Company recorded $23.8 million of operating expenses for the three months ended March 31, 2024, compared to $2.2 million for the same period in 2023. The Company recorded a $23.1 million non-cash loss on revaluation of the financial asset during the first quarter of 2024. The non-cash loss on revaluation of the financial asset relates to the Company's investment in Block 11B/12B and was due to changes in base assumptions for discount rate.  At March 31, 2024, the Company had cash of $1.6 million and working capital deficiency of $6.0 million compared to cash and working capital of $1.7 million at December 31, 2023. The reduction in working capital since December 31, 2023, can be mainly attributed to the amount due on the promissory note becoming a current liability, as it is due March 31, 2025. On December 19, 2022, the Company entered into a promissory note for $5.0 million. On November 7, 2023, amendments were made to increase the total amount available under the promissory note to $8.3 million, with a maturity date of March 31, 2025. At March 31, 2024, the Company had $2.0 million remaining available on the promissory note.  CORPORATE UPDATE  Africa Energy's Board of Directors has agreed that Robert Nicolella, the Company's Chief Executive Officer, be appointed as a Board nominee for election to the board as an executive director at the Annual General and Special Meeting on June 20, 2024.

"Trump's Secret Plan to End Currency Wars - Daily Reckoning","https://dailyreckoning.com/trumps-secret-plan-to-end-currency-wars/","Trump's Secret Plan to End Currency Wars  There has been a lot reported in recent days about the return of currency wars. This story arises in the context of a likely Trump election victory in the November presidential elections.  Trump badly bungled his transition after first being elected president in 2016. He wasn't ready with a long list of loyal appointees.  Many of his senior appointments such as Rex Tillerson as secretary of state, James Mattis as secretary of defense and John Kelly as chief of staff secretly disliked Trump but accepted their roles as so-called ""adult supervision"" around the supposedly reckless Trump.  They thwarted his agenda. That backstabbing came on top of the large number of Obama holdovers in the deep state who saw themselves as a ""resistance"" movement.  Trump is doing a better job of preparing for a second term as president, but the resistance isn't sitting still either. They're moving to disable a new Trump administration even before the election.  The currency wars stories are part of that effort.  Trump Wants to Devalue the Dollar  As reported by The Washington Post, Politico, The Wall Street Journal, Yahoo Finance and other outlets, Trump's working on a secret plan to devalue the U.S. dollar. The goal would be to cheapen U.S. exports and thereby help the U.S. balance of trade and create exported-related jobs.  But the critics say this will only increase U.S. inflation as Americans have to pay more for their imported goods using cheaper dollars. The critics also say that other countries will retaliate against the U.S. by cheapening their own currencies (that's the essence of a currency war) and no country will be any further ahead.  In fact, the entire world will be worse off.  Before looking more closely at what's actually going on, some basics about a currency war should be explained. The first rule is that the world is not always in a currency war.  The periods from 1944-1971 (the original Bretton Woods era) and 1987-2010 (the period of the Washington Consensus) were times of currency peace. This contrasts with 1921-1936 (Currency War I), 1967-1987 (Currency War II) and the current period since 2010 (Currency War III).  The second rule is that currency wars can last for 15 years or longer. It comes as no surprise that the currency war that commenced in 2010 is still going strong 14 years later in 2024. And that points to another key aspect of this debate.  The currency war being written about today by the media is not a new currency war. It's the same one that has been going on since 2010. We're simply in a new phase or a new battle.  Retaliation Is Inevitable  It is true that cheapening your currency can import inflation. Sometimes that's a legitimate policy goal if your country has been suffering from excessive deflation (gradual, moderate consumer price deflation caused by greater market efficiency and competition is economically beneficial).  That's obviously not the case in the U.S. today.  It's also true that cheapening your currency can export deflation as trading partners pay less for your goods. That's what China was doing to the entire world from 1994-2010 and that's why the U.S. launched a currency war in 2010 -- to fight back against disinflation and borderline deflation caused by cheap Chinese goods.  Currency wars can also shift jobs overseas and destroy domestic manufacturing as the terms of trade shift based on changing currency values. Retaliation is always waiting right around the corner in any currency war. The U.S. dollar hit an all-time low in August 2011, which was consistent with the U.S. goal of trying to import inflation.  But Europe struck back, and the EUR/USD cross-rate crashed from $1.60 to $1.04 as a result. So it is correct that no one wins a currency war, and everyone is damaged in the process due to volatility, uncertainty and the costs of conducting the war.  Trump's Plan: Currency Peace  So are the critics right that Trump has a secret plan to devalue the dollar? And are they right that this new stage in the currency war will bring inflation and hurt the U.S. economy?  The critics are wrong and don't understand what Trump's actually trying to do. Trump isn't trying to start a currency war; he's trying to end it once and for all.  In the first place, no president has the power to unilaterally devalue the dollar. That might have been possible under the gold standard or some standard of fixed exchange rates, but that hasn't been the state of the world since 1973.  Exchange rates fluctuate based on a number of factors including interest rates, industrial growth, exchange controls, central bank interventions, capital flows, tax rates and many other macroeconomic variables. But the idea that the president can just wave his hand and devalue the dollar is false.  Far from the reckless, inflationary process the media claim, Trump's actual plan is based on the highly successful model developed by James Baker for Ronald Reagan and implemented in the Plaza Accord of 1985 and the Louvre Accord of 1987.  Currency Peace Leads to Prosperity  After the severe economic recession of 1982 and Paul Volcker's policy of moving interest rates to 20%, inflation in the U.S. was finally reigned in. Inflation dropped from 13.5% in 1980 to 6.1% in 1982 and then 3.2% in 1983.  Investment in the U.S. went on a tear. U.S. real growth was 16% from 1983-1986. Everyone wanted dollars to invest in the U.S. and the dollar boomed reaching an all-time high in 1985.  Finally, the Reagan administration decided the U.S. dollar was too strong and was hurting U.S. exports and jobs. Treasury Secretary James Baker convened a meeting of the finance ministers of France, Germany, Japan, the U.K. and the U.S. at the Plaza Hotel in New York City.  The purpose was not to fight a currency war. The purpose was to create order in currency markets out of the chaos that had prevailed since 1973.  The parties reached a joint agreement that would devalue the U.S. dollar in an orderly fashion versus the French franc, Japanese yen, U.K. pounds sterling and the German Deutsche Mark.  Once the targeted level for the dollar was achieved, the parties would use their best efforts including market intervention as needed to maintain those levels within narrow bands.  A separate meeting in Paris at the Louvre in 1987 agreed that the devaluation phase was over and the dollar would be maintained at the new parities. This was not currency war; it was currency peace achieved by agreement and implemented in a cooperative fashion.  Plaza Accord II  The Louvre Accord (this time including the U.S., the U.K., France, Germany, Japan and Canada) ushered in a period of global prosperity that lasted 20 years until the Global Financial Crisis of 2008.  Trump's goal is to repeat the success of the Plaza and Louvre accords. Trump's adviser on this is Robert Lighthizer, who is one of the most brilliant financial minds around and was Trump's U.S. trade representative (2017-2021).  Lighthizer was also USTR for Ronald Reagan from 1983-1985 so he's a veteran of prior currency wars and was in the administration around the time the Plaza Accord was being developed. Lighthizer is the perfect individual to help Trump achieve the kind of success that Reagan and Baker had in the 1980s.  The media are trying to portray Trump as reckless when he's proposing something highly beneficial for U.S. jobs and U.S. industry. Don't be fooled by false claims of new currency wars.  Trump's plan could actually achieve a new era of currency stability and lasting prosperity."

"Major Scots venue and arts space up for sale","https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/money/12683857/major-venue-arts-space-summerhall-edinburgh-sale/","A MAJOR Scottish venue and arts space has been put up for sale.  The owners of Summerhall in Edinburgh are putting the iconic Fringe Festival site on the market.  Oesselmann Estate Limited announced their intention to sell the building with all the current licences included.  But planned events including the Edinburgh Festival Fringe 2024 and all year-round events will still take place as planned.  Over 110 companies make up the vibrant two acre arts village at the former vet school building.  And Summerhall Management Ltd hope to work closely with the agent and owners during the process to continue to build upon all that has been achieved over 13 years for the arts and culture of Edinburgh and Scotland.  Summerhall is world-renowned for its Fringe programme and, in August, annually presents the best emerging performances and visual art from across the UK and internationally.  Year-round, the building is a vibrant arts village, with over 100 small businesses, freelancers and brands working from its studios and offices.  And it also houses a leading visual arts programme, a live music programme - Mare Music - as well as commercial lettings, a cinema, pub, cafe and more.  Robert McDowell, Director of Summerhall Management Ltd: ""In 2011, buying the old Vet School Buildings was ambitious - a small team worked alongside me to bring in some of the best arts in Edinburgh especially during the Festivals and year-round including the Science Festival and others such as year-round art and music programmes.  ""I am so proud to say that I have been part of building a space that adheres to the original spirit of the festival and has provided a space for artists, creators and makers to play, build and grow over the years.  ""My hope is that with new owners buying the building, Summerhall will be strengthened for the future - and continue its miraculously extraordinary activities, new investment and vigour for the next decade and beyond...""  Stephen Kay of CuthbertWhite: ""We are excited to be bringing this to the open market and we expect considerable interest in this property from a wide range of domestic and international parties.  ""It is an important landmark in the history of Edinburgh, occupying an enviable location overlooking The Meadows."""
