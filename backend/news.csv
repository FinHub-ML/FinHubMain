"Boy's death at intersection prompts grief-stricken plea for pedestrian safety overhaul","https://www.abc.net.au/news/2024-05-15/parents-seek-road-safety-son-william-ellis-killed-at-balranald/103836806","The day Kylie Reid found out her breast cancer was in remission was the same day she lost her son.  ""I had just found out the cancer was gone and then I got the phone call that my little boy had died,"" she said.  It was a week before his eighth birthday last year. Christmas was 12 days away.  William ""Will"" Ellis was walking home from school with his three older sisters when he was hit by a car in the NSW border town of Balranald.  Ms Reid -- who had been diagnosed with stage three breast cancer and was in Melbourne for her last cancer appointment -- raced home to discover Will had been taken to Mildura.  Will was crossing the town's main street, a section of the Sturt Highway -- a major freight route connecting Sydney with Adelaide.  Will's dad, Shaun Ellis, said no one saw the car coming, not Will, his sisters who watched the tragedy unfold, or a witness.  ""[The driver] just didn't see him,"" he said.  ""Locals know, they go slow because they know the schoolkids are heading across the road. He [the driver] wasn't local,"" Ms Reid said.  For years, the community has asked for the highway to be made safer for locals going to and from schools, a library, age-care facilities and a supermarket along the main drag.  The Local Traffic Committee made up of Balranald Shire Council, NSW Roads and Transport for NSW (formerly the Roads and Traffic Authority), and police meet regularly to discuss road safety.  Minutes from 2004 show that Balranald Shire Council asked for the speed limit on Market Street to be reduced from 50 to 40 kilometres per hour, with the addition of a supervised children's crossing be considered.  Mr Ellis said that at the intersection where Will died, traffic signs alerting drivers to pedestrians were too tall, and obscured drivers and adult pedestrians from seeing each other.  Improving the visibility of pedestrians at that intersection was also raised in 2004.  Minutes from a February 2009 meeting show that an RTA representative said a formal pedestrian crossing would not be supported as it could be detrimental to them if vehicles did not give them right of way.  Minutes from 2017 indicate a local councillor proposed a children's crossing at We Street, where Will died, but the committee said children were the responsibility of their respective schools until they returned to their parents and guardians.  Minutes from 2022 and 2023 showed Transport for NSW supported the introduction of a High Pedestrian Activity Area (HPAA), with a 40kph speed limit.  Public feedback sought by the council for the proposed pedestrian zone was unanimously positive and the committee hoped it could be completed in time for the Christmas holidays.  ""It's heartbreaking nothing's been done,"" Ms Reid said.  Will's parents are now lobbying the NSW government to act to avoid a similar accident happening to someone else.  At the time of publication, their petition for a pedestrian or school crossing had garnered more than 2,000 signatures.  Ms Reid said that while Will's grandmother was gathering signatures, she had counted more than 135 B-double trucks and semi-trailers in about two hours.  ""They need to get their act together,"" Mr Ellis said.  ""My son was worth more than stopping a truck for five minutes. His life mattered a lot more than that.""  Ms Reid said Will's death had devastated the whole family.  ""We go through the motions every day but it's just horrible.""  Data from the Centre for Road Safety showed Will's was the only fatality on Market Street between 2018 and 2023.  A coronial inquest is underway.  In a statement, Transport for NSW said it was deeply saddened by the death of Will, and it intended to install an HPAA by June 30 on Market Street.  Transport for NSW's regional director west Alistair Lunn met with Will's parents and is working with them and Balranald Shire council to investigate other safety features that could be introduced.  These included installing extra fencing, additional HPAA signage, roadside furniture and landscaping."
"NAR lawsuits, Covid-19 push real estate agents to reconsider their brokerages","https://www.bizjournals.com/bizjournals/news/2024/05/14/nar-lawsuit-settlement-class-action-real-estate.html","The Covid-19 pandemic and a recent wave of class-action lawsuits have pushed more real estate agents to consider leaving their brokerages.  Those findings, from the latest annual Agent Priorities Report from Coldwell Banker Real Estate, found while 61% of agents surveyed plan on sticking with their company this year, that's down from 75% in 2023.  ""Given today's challenging landscape, many agents have become more open to leaving their current company and working with a partner who best supports their personal and career goals,"" said Jason Waugh, president of Coldwell Banker Affiliates.  The biggest reasons cited by agents about why they would want to switch brokers include more referrals and leads, better training and education, and a better commission structure.  More agents showed an increased interest in brokerages' luxury expertise, at 66% in this year's survey compared to 51% in 2023, as well as whether they had a strong global presence, at 65% this year compared to 50% in 2023.  The shift in real estate agent sentiment comes amid months of legal wrangling and class-action lawsuits over buyer commissions that many believe could reshape the industry.  One such case led to a jury verdict of $1.78 billion in Missouri in November against HomeServices of America and other big brokers.  Additionally, a $418 million settlement was reached with the National Association of Realtors and more than $275.25 million in other settlements were reached with several industry heavyweights.  The settlements are expected to reshape how buyer commissions are approached -- a change many have predicted could lead some real estate agents to reconsider their futures in the industry.  Maureen McDermut, a Realtor at Sotheby's International-Montecito in California, said brand trust and marketing help are among the top desired things agents want from a brokerage, and after the recent NAR settlement, brands with prominent reputations will attract more agents.  ""Smaller brokerages may or may not have the capital to market effectively, and many agents need help with the new commission ecosystem that is going into effect,"" McDermut said.  Agents that cannot effectively present their value to clients will have a hard time breaking through the noise of bigger brokerages with respect to marketing and advertising, McDermut said.  ""There is always a lot of turnover in residential real estate,"" she continued. ""Covid probably slowed this a bit, but now things are changing and more agents will look to grow their careers with strong marketing and branding, which larger nationally recognized brokerages are able to provide.""  Greg Clement, CEO of Realeflow LLC, a data and real estate investing software firm, said the real estate industry has faced significant disruptions during the pandemic, which has lead to greater work flexibility, while class-action lawsuits have underscored the need for more transparency.  ""These events have collectively fed into a landscape where real estate agents are increasingly prioritizing firms that offer robust support, advanced technology and flexible working conditions,"" Clement said. ""Agents want to align with trust.""  Ultimately, agents are not just looking for a brand to work under, they want a brokerage that actively supports their growth and adapts to the changing landscape -- including an economy that is constantly shifting, Clement said.  ""Looking ahead, the industry will see heightened turnover among agents, as they seek affiliations that align more closely with their evolving expectations and the dynamic market conditions,"" he said. ""In the next year or two, expect to see a significant shift as agents migrate towards companies that offer not just stability, but also a forward-thinking approach to business, technology and support."""

These restricted shares are part of the issuer's 2020 Equity Incentive Plan and are set to vest fully on March 7, 2025.

Behar at First Northwest Bancorp (NASDAQ:FNWB), the company's financial health and future profitability are of keen interest to investors. An analysis of recent data and metrics from InvestingPro provides a clearer picture of the company's current standing.  The company's market capitalization stands at $95.19 million, reflecting its valuation in the market. Despite the company's challenges, including weak gross profit margins and not being profitable over the last twelve months, there's a silver lining as analysts predict FNWB will turn profitable this year. This aligns with Behar's recent investment, potentially indicating an expectation of improved financial performance.  InvestingPro Tips highlight that FNWB has a high shareholder yield, which is an encouraging sign for investors looking for returns. However, it's worth noting that the stock price has experienced a significant decline over the last three months, with a 23.39% drop in total return. The company's P/E ratio is currently negative at -111.25, which is adjusted to -108.41 for the last twelve months as of Q1 2024, suggesting that earnings are not keeping pace with the stock price, a factor that investors should consider.  Yet, the company's dividend yield stands at an attractive 2.58%, with the last dividend having an ex-date of May 9, 2024. This could be a draw for income-focused investors, especially in light of the director's recent share purchase. Additionally, the company's fair value, as assessed by InvestingPro, is set at $10.23, slightly below the recent closing price of $10.6, indicating that the stock might be fairly valued at its current level.

"Suspect in shooting of 2 Jewish men in Los Angeles last year agrees to plead guilty to hate crimes","http://hosted.ap.org/article/2a7da2cb7daf0406546744b42bbc4def/suspect-shooting-2-jewish-men-los-angeles-last-year-agrees","LOS ANGELES (AP) -- A 29-year-old man accused of shooting and wounding two Jewish men as they left synagogues in Los Angeles last year has agreed to plead guilty to hate crimes and firearms offenses, federal prosecutors said Tuesday.  The February 2023 shootings raised fears among the city's Jewish community after officials said the victims were targeted because they wore clothing that identified their faith, including black coats and head coverings. Both of them survived.  The U.S. Attorney's Office said Jaime Tran agreed to plead guilty to all charges against him: two counts of hate crimes with intent to kill and two counts of discharging a firearm during a crime of violence.  Tran will enter his plea in the coming weeks and as part of his deal with prosecutors will receive a prison sentence of between 35 years and 40 years, the office said in a statement.  ""This defendant sought to murder two men simply because they were Jewish,"" U.S. Attorney Martin Estrada said in the statement. ""We will remain firm in our approach of using all the tools at our disposal to aggressively prosecute acts of hate.""  Tran told law enforcement that he looked online for a ""kosher market"" and decided to shoot someone nearby, according to an FBI affidavit.  Tran has ""history of antisemitic and threatening conduct,"" the affidavit said, citing a review of emails, text messages and unspecified reports.  In 2022, it said, he emailed former classmates using insulting language about Jewish people and also threatened a Jewish former classmate, repeatedly sending messages like ""Someone is going to kill you, Jew"" and ""I want you dead, Jew."""
"Treasurer's Theory of Economics to Be Put to the Test","https://www.theepochtimes.com/world/chalmers-theory-of-economics-to-be-put-to-the-test-will-cost-of-living-relief-fuel-or-tame-inflation-5650032","The treasurer defends cost-of-living relief, disputing inflationary impacts.  The government brands its budget as an inflation-fighting weapon of precision but economists warn broad cost-of-living relief such as energy rebates and tax cuts for all may make things worse.  An expanded version of the energy bill relief delivered in last year's budget and another boost to Commonwealth Rent Assistance are expected to help tame the consumer price index.  Treasury forecasts on the budget on the night of May 14 have those measures reducing inflation by about half a percentage point in the next financial year, possibly providing relief by Christmas.  Committee for Economic Development chief economist Cassandra Winzar said handing out cost-of-living relief via the stage three tax cuts and energy bill relief that's not means tested risked working against the central bank.  ""Electricity rebates may alleviate headline inflation but will drive spending elsewhere,"" Ms. Winzar said.  Treasurer Jim Chalmers defended the government's decision to provide cost-of-living relief for all Australians, not just lower-income households, and confirmed it was the Treasury's view it would not be inflationary.  ""The clear advice we got from Treasury was that by designing our cost of living package the way we have will take the edge off inflation and won't add to inflationary pressures elsewhere in the economy,"" he told ABC TV after the budget.  ""We took that advice very seriously and we proceeded on that basis.""  Economist and budget expert Chris Richardson said the budget was expansionary, with $9.5 billion (US$6.3 billion) in new spending in the next 12 months.  ""The government said it wouldn't front-load stuff, it would be careful not to poke the inflationary bear, it would put it at the back -- they have absolutely got it in the front,"" he said."
