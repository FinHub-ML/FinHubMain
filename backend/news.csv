""In Q1 we achieved comparative revenue growth for the 15th consecutive quarter as expected thanks to versatility of our business model,"" said Christopher Clemente, Comstock's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. ""Our impressive increase in fee-based property and parking management revenue will drive future results, thanks particularly to the efforts of our rapidly growing ParkX team. The high-quality assets in our managed portfolio remain in demand, best evidenced by our ability to sign 5 new tenants in Q1 at The Hartford in Arlington's vibrant Clarendon neighborhood. Finally, we reached a significant milestone this quarter with the initial delivery of managed assets from The Row at Reston Station, the $1.3 billion development that will drive our next significant growth phase. I am pleased with our first quarter progress and look forward to adding to our success story throughout the remainder of 2024.""

The following table presents a reconciliation of net income (loss) from continuing operations, the most directly comparable financial measure as measured in accordance with GAAP, to Adjusted EBITDA:

The $0.1 million decrease in Adjusted EBITDA is primarily driven by higher supplemental revenue from leasing finders' fees in 2023, partially offset by an increase in recurring fee-based property management revenue in the current period.

We define Adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss) from continuing operations, excluding the impact of interest expense (net of interest income), income taxes, depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation, and gain or loss on equity method investments in real estate ventures.

We use Adjusted EBITDA to evaluate financial performance, analyze the underlying trends in our business and establish operational goals and forecasts that are used when allocating resources. We expect to compute Adjusted EBITDA consistently using the same methods each period.

We believe Adjusted EBITDA is a useful measure because it permits investors to better understand changes over comparative periods by providing financial results that are unaffected by certain non-cash items that are not considered by management to be indicative of our operational performance.

While we believe that Adjusted EBITDA is useful to investors when evaluating our business, it is not prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP, and therefore should be considered supplemental in nature. Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered in isolation, or as a substitute, for other financial performance measures presented in accordance with GAAP. Adjusted EBITDA may differ from similarly titled measures presented by other companies."
