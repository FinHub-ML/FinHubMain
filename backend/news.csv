Jackie O's stunning sex confession SHOCKS co-host Kyle,https://www.perthnow.com.au/entertainment/kyle-sandilands-shocked-at-radio-co-host-jackie-os-sex-confession-c-14658278,"After more than 20 years sharing the airwaves, you'd think shock jocks Kyle Sandilands and Jackie 'O' Henderson might've squeezed every colourful confession out of each other over the stretch.

Two weeks after launching their breakfast show in Melbourne, the pair told News.com.au a few scandalous stories that had slipped through the cracks.

Tasked with a cheeky game of ""Never have I ever (had sex with a celebrity)"", Kyle was the first to disclose his hit list.

""Models, celebrities, actors, singers, I've banged them all,"" he boasted.

However, unaware his work wife too had shared her body with a celeb, Kyle was gobsmacked she'd been so tight-lipped about her conquest.

Blowing off the forthcoming interrogation, the 49-year-old mother told Kyle it wasn't a famous sportsman or chef.

Married twice before, Jackie openly shares dating stories on the pair's radio show.

Most commonly meeting potential suitors through mutual friends, Jackie spoke recently about sharing the bedroom with a fan.

""Halfway through sex, he says, 'I can't believe I'm having sex with Jackie O',"" she admitted during the broadcast.

While the bronzed blonde suggested she'd prefer to date someone with ""nothing to do with the entertainment industry"", Kyle believed he'd narrowed Jackie's type to a tee.

Or more specifically, ""some bussy boy with a moustache that looks amazing in some Billabong boardshorts down at the pub"".

But he didn't stop at her ideal man's appearance.

""Jackie thinks broke d**k (poor) men give better sex because they've got nothing else going for them,"" he said. ""A wealthy man in his Audi, he doesn't know how to please a woman.""

""I never said that,"" Jackie responded, but did concede, ""Tradies are better than ... guys that are killing it in finance"".

Recalling life as a ""cokehead"" following his first marriage's demise, the 52-year-old admitted he ""just banged everyone who wanted to be banged"".

""This is going to sound like a lie, but (I had) 15 girls in one room at once and just me... they were really eager to please me,"" Kyle insisted.

""I think maybe I had to pull out halfway (through). I thought, 'I can't please them all'.""

Not to be outshone, Jackie revealed she once had a sex dream about her co-host before admitting her parents accidentally caught her ""self-pleasuring"" in the bath in her younger years."

"On Stormy Daniels payments, Trump told Michael Cohen, 'Just do it,' former fixer alleges",https://www.yahoo.com/news/stormy-daniels-payments-trump-told-013400091.html,"NEW YORK -- In hotly anticipated testimony Monday, Michael Cohen took the stand at Donald Trump's historic hush money trial as one of the final witnesses, telling a Manhattan jury of how he painstakingly arranged to pay off a porn star to influence the results of the 2016 election, working directly off the boss' orders: ""Just do it.""

During more than five hours in the witness box, Trump's former lawyer and fixer described his boss as a micromanager who was intimately familiar with everything that went on beneath him and himself as Trump's loyal lackey -- one who would bully, lie and threaten to sue anyone who stood in the way of accomplishing the task the boss assigned him ""to make him happy.""

Trump was involved in every last detail, Cohen said.

""Everything required Mr. Trump's sign-off,"" he testified in state Supreme Court in Manhattan, sitting feet away from his longtime boss turned arch-nemesis.

No matter the issue, ""You would go straight back and tell him, especially if it was a matter that was troubling to him.""

Trump's micromanagement as a business leader extended to his campaign for president, Cohen told the court, describing him as deeply entangled in efforts to hide a series of alleged sex scandals involving former Playboy model Karen McDougal, a Trump Tower doorman and porn star Stormy Daniels.

Cohen said he was tasked with paying off the adult film star $130,000 on the eve of the 2016 election amid the ""catastrophic"" release of the ""Access Hollywood"" tape, describing Trump as being furious it was even an issue -- with Cohen having worked to silence her years beforehand.

""He said to me, this -- this is a disaster. Total disaster. Women are going to hate me. Guys may think it's cool,"" Cohen quoted Trump as saying. ""This is going to be a disaster for the campaign.""

The former fixer said Trump ordered him to ""just take care of it,"" and to delay paying her off until after the election.

""Because if I win, it will have no relevance,"" Cohen quoted Trump. ""If I lose, I don't really care.""

When the infamous ""Access Hollywood"" tape came out -- in which Trump was heard on a hot mic bragging about molesting women -- Cohen said it was Trump's wife's idea to excuse it as ""locker room talk.""

""At least he told me, that's what Melania (Trump) thought it was and (to) use that to get control over the story and to minimize its impact on him and his campaign,"" Cohen said.

Trump, 77, is charged with 34 felony counts of falsification of business records, which are each tied to his alleged reimbursement to Cohen for paying off Daniels. Prosecutors say the payments were falsely logged as legal fees. The criminal charges are the first ever filed against a former U.S. president.

Prosecutors allege the payments represented the last stage of a conspiracy to influence the results of the election Trump won, orchestrated in August 2015 at Trump Tower at a meeting attended by Cohen, his boss and David Pecker, the former tabloid publisher and chairman of America Media Inc., or AMI.

""What was discussed is the power of the National Enquirer in terms of being located at the cash register or so many supermarkets and bodegas -- that if we could place positive stories about Mr. Trump that would be beneficial, that if we could place negative stories about some of the other candidates -- that would also be beneficial,"" Cohen told the court of the meeting.

Bolstering testimony jurors heard from Pecker at the beginning of the trial, Cohen said the tabloid publisher told him and Trump that ""he could keep an eye out for anything negative about Mr. Trump and that he would be able to help us to know in advance"" to ""try to stop it from coming out.""

Cohen, 57, went to prison for the payoff to Daniels after pleading guilty to federal offenses in 2018. They barely looked in each other's direction when Cohen walked into the courtroom around 9:30 a.m. and throughout his day on the stand.

Cohen, who frequently addressed the jury while answering Hoffinger's questions, said his boss was directly aware he needed to be reimbursed for the money he paid Daniels after wiring it to her lawyer through a shell company, which he said Trump also knew about. He explained how Trump's convicted former finance chief Allen Weisselberg tallied that he was owed $420,000 after doubling the expense to account for taxes and tacking on a bonus and another $50,000 expense.

Cohen laughed when asked why he had to set up a fake account to deposit the money.

""Oh, I'm not sure they would've opened it if I stated it (was) to pay off an adult film star,"" he said.

He explained that Trump promised to pay him back while he was on vacation in December 2016, when he blew up being shorted on his bonus by two-thirds.

""Don't worry about that other thing,"" he quoted Trump as saying. ""I'm going to take care of it when you get back.""

The former fixer directly tied Trump to the payments at the heart of the case. His first day of testimony yielded little evidence the jury hadn't already seen, instead weaving together the paper trail prosecutors have laid out over the past four weeks in bank records, emails, text messages and call logs during testimony from 17 witnesses.

The defense has sought to portray Cohen as untrustworthy and unhinged -- claiming he went rogue in paying off Daniels -- but the fixer told the jury his fealty to his boss wasn't so strong that he'd part with $130,000 with no expectation he'd be paid back.

Cohen challenged the defense's claims that Trump was unaware of what Cohen was up to at any given moment and that any efforts on his part to hide unflattering information from his past were intended to protect his family.

During one line of questioning, prosecutor Susan Hoffinger asked Cohen if he brought up Melania Trump in his conversation with Trump about Daniels, who he said told him, ""Don't worry.""

Cohen said Trump never told him whether Daniels' claims of a 2006 tryst in a Lake Tahoe hotel room, which Trump has strongly denied, were valid. When the porn star's story was first published on a blog in 2011, he said Trump didn't directly address its veracity but bragged about her being attracted to him.

""He told me that he was playing golf with Big Ben Roethlisberger and they had met Stormy Daniels and others there, but she liked Mr. Trump -- that women prefer Trump even over someone like Big Ben,"" Cohen said.

When McDougal came forward with claims months before Daniels, which AMI would ultimately pay her $150,000 to stay quiet about, Cohen said Trump similarly took a moment to brag.

""His response was, 'She's really beautiful,'"" Cohen recounted. ""I said, 'OK, but there's a story that's right now being shopped.'""

Trump's directive, Cohen said: ""Make sure it doesn't get released.""

Cohen is expected to continue on the stand Tuesday and is slated to face a cross-examination for the ages when Trump's legal team gets its time with him in the witness box."
Dollar drifts as traders eye US inflation data; frail yen in focus,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/dollar-drifts-traders-eye-us-013825965.html,"SINGAPORE (Reuters) - The dollar was steady on Tuesday as investors awaited an inflation report this week that will likely shape the U.S. rates outlook, while the yen was hovering near a two-week low, stoking intervention worries.

The currency market has been sedate this week, with investors seeking to gauge what the path the Federal Reserve will take this year in the wake of recent softer-than-expected U.S. labour market data and comments from central bankers.

They have had to dial back their expectations of rate cuts this year due to sticky inflation and are now pricing in 42 basis points of easing this year, with 60% chance of a cut in September, according to CME FedWatch tool.

All eyes this week will be on the consumer price index on Wednesday which is expected to show core CPI rose 0.3% month-on-month in April, less than 0.4% growth the prior month, according to a Reuters poll.

But before that, U.S. Producer Price Index is due to be released later on Tuesday, which analysts will parse through to get a sense of whether inflation is heading towards the Fed's target of 2%.

""The focus will centre on the key items that feed into core personal consumption expenditures (PCE), i.e., healthcare services, portfolio management, and domestic airfares,"" said Tony Sycamore, market analyst at IG.

The euro was little changed at $1.0786 but is up 1% against the dollar so far this month, while sterling last bought $1.2554, up roughly 0.5% so far in May.

The dollar index, which measures the U.S. currency against six rivals, was last at 105.25.

Nearly two-thirds of economists expect the Fed to cut its key interest rate twice this year, starting in September, a Reuters poll showed. That's up from a just over half of economists in the previous survey.

YEN WORRIES

Traders are back on tenterhooks as the yen nears levels that saw suspected interventions by Tokyo. It was last at 156.32 per U.S. dollar, having touched a two-week low of 156.40 earlier in the session.

Japan's Ministry of Finance is suspected to have intervened in the currency market at the end of April through early May after the yen hit a 34-year low of 160.245 on April 29.

But the market remains bearish on the currency given the massive gap between Japan's ultra-low yields and those in other major economies.

Japan's Finance Minister Shunichi Suzuki said on Tuesday the government will closely work with the Bank of Japan on the foreign exchange to ensure there is no friction between their mutual policy objectives.

""We'll take all possible measures to closely monitor the currency,"" Suzuki said, adding it is important for the exchange rate to move in a stable manner reflecting fundamentals, rather than focusing on its level.

The yen was briefly supported on Monday when the Bank of Japan sent a hawkish signal by cutting its offer amount for a segment of Japanese government bonds.

Meanwhile, International Monetary Fund said Japan's commitment to allow the yen to move flexibly will help the central bank focus on achieving price stability, warning against growing calls by some analysts to use monetary policy to slow the currency's decline.

In other currencies, the Australian dollar and New Zealand dollar were both flat in early trading. The Aussie last fetched $0.6608, while the kiwi was at $0.6017.

"Star witness Michael Cohen says Trump was intimately involved in all aspects of hush money scheme - WSVN 7News | Miami News, Weather, Sports | Fort Lauderdale",https://wsvn.com/news/politics/star-witness-michael-cohen-says-trump-was-intimately-involved-in-all-aspects-of-hush-money-scheme/,"NEW YORK (AP) -- Donald Trump was intimately involved with all aspects of a scheme to stifle stories about sex that threatened to torpedo his 2016 campaign, his former lawyer said Monday in matter-of-fact testimony that went to the heart of the former president's hush money trial.

""Everything required Mr. Trump's sign-off,"" said Michael Cohen, Trump's fixer-turned-foe and the prosecution's star witness in a case now entering its final, pivotal stretch.

In hours of highly anticipated testimony, Cohen placed Trump at the center of the hush money plot, saying the then-candidate had promised to reimburse the lawyer for the money he fronted and was constantly updated about behind-the-scenes efforts to bury stories feared to be harmful to the campaign.

""We need to stop this from getting out,"" Cohen quoted Trump as telling him in reference to porn actor Stormy Daniels' account of a sexual encounter with Trump a decade earlier. The then-candidate was especially anxious about how the story would affect his standing with female voters.

A similar episode occurred when Cohen alerted Trump that a Playboy model was alleging that she and Trump had an extramarital affair. ""Make sure it doesn't get released,"" was Cohen's message to Trump, the lawyer said. The woman, Karen McDougal, was paid $150,000 in an arrangement that was made after Trump received a ""complete and total update on everything that transpired.""

""What I was doing, I was doing at the direction of and benefit of Mr. Trump,"" Cohen testified.

Trump has pleaded not guilty and denied having sexual encounters with the two women.

Cohen is by far the prosecution's most important witness, and though his testimony lacked the electricity that defined Daniels' turn on the stand last week, he nonetheless linked Trump directly to the payments and helped illuminate some of the drier evidence such as text messages and phone logs that jurors had previously seen.

The testimony of a witness with such intimate knowledge of Trump's activities could heighten the legal exposure of the presumptive Republican presidential nominee if jurors deem him sufficiently credible. But prosecutors' reliance on a witness with such a checkered past -- Cohen pleaded guilty to federal charges related to the payments -- also carries sizable risks with a jury and could be a boon to Trump politically as he fundraises off his legal woes and paints the case as the product of a tainted criminal justice system.

The men, once so close that Cohen boasted that he would ""take a bullet"" for Trump, had no visible interaction inside the courtroom. The sedate atmosphere was a marked contrast from their last courtroom faceoff, when Trump walked out of the courtroom in October after his lawyer finished questioning Cohen during his civil fraud trial.

This time around, Trump sat at the defense table with his eyes closed for long stretches of testimony as Cohen recounted his decade-long career as a senior Trump Organization executive, doing work that by his own admission sometimes involved lying and bullying others on his boss's behalf.

Jurors had previously heard from others about the tabloid industry practice of ""catch-and-kill,"" in which rights to a story are purchased so that it can then be quashed. But Cohen's testimony, which continues Tuesday, is crucial to prosecutors because of his direct communication with the then-candidate about embarrassing stories he was scrambling to suppress.

Cohen also matters because the reimbursements he received from a $130,000 hush money payment to Daniels, which prosecutors say was meant to buy her silence in advance of the election, form the basis of 34 felony counts charging Trump with falsifying business records. Prosecutors say the reimbursements were logged, falsely, as legal expenses to conceal the payments' true purpose. Defense lawyers say the payments to Cohen were properly categorized as legal expenses.

Under questioning from a prosecutor, Cohen detailed the steps he took to mask the payments. When he opened a bank account to pay Daniels, an action he said he told Trump he was taking, he told the bank it was for a new limited liability corporation but withheld the actual purpose.

""I'm not sure they would've opened it,"" he said, if they knew it was ""to pay off an adult film star for a nondisclosure agreement.""

To establish Trump's familiarity with the payments, Cohen told the jury that Trump had promised to reimburse him. The two men even discussed with Allen Weisselberg, a former Trump Organization chief financial officer, how the reimbursements would be paid as legal services over monthly installments, Cohen testified.

And though Trump's lawyers have said he acted to protect his family from salacious stories, Cohen described Trump as preoccupied instead by the impact they would have on the campaign.

He said Trump even sought to delay finalizing the Daniels transaction until after Election Day so he wouldn't have to pay her.

""Because,"" Cohen testified, ""after the election it wouldn't matter"" to Trump.

Cohen also gave jurors an insider account of his negotiations with David Pecker, the then-publisher of the National Enquirer, who was such a close Trump ally that Pecker told Cohen his publication maintained a ""file drawer or a locked drawer"" where files related to Trump were kept.

That effort took on added urgency following the October 2016 disclosure of an ""Access Hollywood"" recording in which Trump was heard boasting about grabbing women sexually.

The Daniels payment was finalized several weeks after that revelation, but Monday's testimony also centered on a deal earlier that fall with McDougal.

Cohen testified that he went to Trump immediately after the National Enquirer alerted him to a story about the alleged McDougal affair. ""Make sure it doesn't get released,"" he said Trump told him.

Trump checked in with Pecker about the matter, asking him how ""things were going"" with it, Cohen said. Pecker responded, 'We have this under control, and we'll take care of this,"" Cohen testified.

Cohen also said he was with Trump as Trump spoke to Pecker on a speakerphone in his Trump Tower office.

""David had stated that it's going to cost them $150,000 to control the story,"" Cohen said. He quoted Trump as saying: ""No problem, I will take care of it,"" which Cohen interpreted to mean that the payment would be reimbursed.

To lay the foundation that the deals were done with Trump's endorsement, prosecutors elicited testimony from Cohen designed to show Trump as a hands-on manager. Acting on Trump's behalf, Cohen said, he sometimes lied and bullied others, including reporters.

""When he would task you with something, he would then say, 'Keep me informed. Let me know what's going on,'"" Cohen testified. He said that was especially true ""if there was a matter that was troubling to him.""

Defense lawyers have teed up a bruising cross-examination of Cohen, telling jurors during opening statements that he's an ""admitted liar"" with an ""obsession to get President Trump.""

Prosecutors aim to blunt those attacks by acknowledging Cohen's past crimes to jurors and by relying on other witnesses whose accounts, they hope, will buttress Cohen's testimony. They include a lawyer who negotiated the hush money payments on behalf of Daniels and McDougal, as well as Pecker and Daniels.

After Cohen's home and office were raided by the FBI in 2018, Trump showered him with affection on social media and predicted that Cohen would not ""flip."" Months later, Cohen did exactly that, pleading guilty to federal campaign-finance charges.

Besides pleading guilty to the hush money payments, Cohen later admitted lying to Congress about a Moscow real estate project that he had pursued on Trump's behalf during the heat of the 2016 campaign. He was sentenced to three years in prison, but spent much of it in home confinement.

Ghana Plans to Leverage Fintech to Spur Small-Sized Companies -  BNN Bloomberg,https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/ghana-plans-to-leverage-fintech-to-spur-small-sized-companies-1.2072472,"(Bloomberg) -- Ghana is planning to leverage financial technology to drive access to capital for its small and medium-sized business sector, a segment that contribute 70% of economic growth.

The country's fintech industry has blossomed with the introduction of new products into the market since Africa's biggest wireless carrier MTN Group Ltd. started mobile-money transfers about 14 years ago. Today, mobile phone users can access bank loans, purchase an insurance policy and buy government bonds among other services via a tap of their mobile phones without having a bank account.

""The Ministry of Finance is finalizing a small and medium-sized enterprises financing strategy which has components such as direct lending to SMEs, providing guarantees to financial institutions, reducing the cost of borrowing and supporting skills and innovation in the SME ecosystem through fintechs,"" Minister of Finance Mohammed Amin Adam, said Monday at the opening of a three-day Africa Fintech Summit in the capital, Accra.

The country signed a $200 million loan with Ecowas Bank for Investment and Development on May 10, that will be lent to small businesses to boost their growth, Adam said later Monday in a post on X.

Nairobi-based telecoms operator Safaricom pioneered the use of mobile-money with the very successful M-Pesa. Mobile-money transactions in Ghana grew 79% in 2023 to 1.9 trillion cedis ($135.2 billion), according to the Bank of Ghana. The number of registered customer accounts increased 19% to 65.6 million, it said.

""Many of the key components for a fintech ecosystem are falling into place in Africa,"" Ravi Menon, a former managing director of the Monetary Authority of Singapore, said in Accra. ""Fintech can demonstrate its true purpose and potential in Africa, by focusing on financial inclusion,"" Menon, who is now the Asian nation's ambassador for climate action, said.

Japan's Ministry of Finance is suspected to have intervened in the currency market at the end of April through early May after the yen hit a 34-year low of 160.245 on April 29.

But the market remains bearish on the currency given the massive gap between Japan's ultra-low yields and those in other major economies.

Japan's Finance Minister Shunichi Suzuki said on Tuesday the government will closely work with the Bank of Japan on the foreign exchange to ensure there is no friction between their mutual policy objectives.

""We'll take all possible measures to closely monitor the currency,"" Suzuki said, adding it is important for the exchange rate to move in a stable manner reflecting fundamentals, rather than focusing on its level.

The yen was briefly supported on Monday when the Bank of Japan sent a hawkish signal by cutting its offer amount for a segment of Japanese government bonds.

Meanwhile, International Monetary Fund said Japan's commitment to allow the yen to move flexibly will help the central bank focus on achieving price stability, warning against growing calls by some analysts to use monetary policy to slow the currency's decline."
